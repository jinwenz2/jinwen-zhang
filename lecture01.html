## Summary of Locations

- Grades and assignment links will be on [Canvas](https://canvas.illinois.edu/).
- PrairieLearn: https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/161389/ where assignments will be completed.
- Course repo is at [UIUC-iSchool-DataViz/spr2025-bcg-bcu](https://github.com/UIUC-iSchool-DataViz/spr2025-bcg-bcu/), automatically built at [uiuc-ischool-dataviz.github.io/spr2025-bcg-bcu/](https://uiuc-ischool-dataviz.github.io/spr2025-bcg-bcu). Lecture notes, notebooks, data and course info will be placed there.
- Slack: https://is445-spr2025.slack.com/ - the best place to ask questions in a `#homeworkX-questions` channel (or `#general` for general questions)

You are invited to clone the repo, fork and submit changes (typos, etc!), and to use any information in it in the future.

notes:

A few notes about this semester -- while assignments will be posted on Canvas, the actual completion of the assignments will take place on the PrairieLearn platform.  We will discuss this in more detail when we get to looking at homework stuff, but in short these will be "online" cloud notebooks that have all the packages you need already installed so you don't have to install (too many) things on your local machine

Also, we will be utilizing Slack for discussing homeworks with a dedicated channel for each assignment. Again, more on this when we get to looking at the homework (as part of your homework is to say hi on slack!)

---

## "Quiz"!

We are going to take a quiz!  (Don't worry, there are no wrong answers.)

On your laptop, open a notepad or scratch text editor.  Answer these questions:

- What are the most memorable movies you saw over the last year?
- Do you prefer cats or dogs?
- How would you quantify your experience in visualization?
- How many hours do you spend online in classes each week?

---

## "Quiz"!

**In a group of about 4 or 5 people**, visualize the results of your group's collective "data.""

- What are the most memorable movies you saw over the last year?
- Do you prefer cats or dogs?
- How would you quantify your experience in visualization?
- How many hours do you spend online in classes each week?

And, be sure to say hi to each other!

---

## Getting Python Setup

If you want to use your own Python setup, I recommend:

1. Download Anaconda: [anaconda.com/download](anaconda.com/download)
1. Ensure that Jupyterlab is installed and working
1. Ensure that you have matplotlib, pandas and numpy installed and working.

However, PrairieLearn has a working installation you may also choose to use.

## Syllabus

 * Week 1 (Today) - Introduction
 * Week 2 - Data Storage and Operations
 * Week 3 - Types of Viz and Choosing Colors
 * Week 4 - Beginning interactivity
 * Week 5 - Continuing interactivity with bqplot
 * Week 6 - More with dashboards & Map Viz (**this class might be "flipped"**)
 * Week 7 - Maps, maps and more maps
 
notes:
This is a rough syllabus!  These are many of the topics we will cover, but
based on how the course proceeds and how folks respond, we may shorten or
lengthen different topics.

The organization here is designed to start out slow, dealing with how to
program python for visualization, understanding how data is laid out, which
operations we can apply to that data, and then moving on to representing data
in different ways.

We might start getting into javascript earlier, depending on how we are doing.

---

## Syllabus, cont

 * Week 8 - Streamlit and Intro to Vega-lite/Altair
 * Week 9 - Spring break, no class!
 * Week 10 - Viz Audience; More Streamlit, Vega-lite (possible JavaScript)
 * Week 11 - Streamlit Apps in HuggingFace
 * Week 12 - A few more Streamlit+HuggingFace things; Publishing Viz
 * Week 13 - Intro to Jekyll
 * Week 14 - More Jekyll+Altair+vega-lite things
 * Week 15 - Scientific Viz & AVL Guest lecture (**partially flipped class**)
 * Week 16 - Network Visualization & Word clouds (**flipped class**)

---

## Syllabus: In summary

 * Weeks 1-5: Basics of visualization (Python)
 * Weeks 6-10: Interactivity and Viz Types (Python and HTML)
 * Weeks 11-16: Platforms and dimensionality (Python, HTML/Javascript, Web-dev methods)

notes:
basically, we'll start with the basics - I'm assuming you are coming in with Python experience

---

## Weeks 1-5

- How are files laid out?
- What is in our operational palette?
- Basics of using Javascript, Python, and writing JSON
- Basic quantitative visualizations

---

## Weeks 6-10

- Distributions of values in different dimensions
- Simple interactivity
- Reactive programming
- Colors, images
- Comparisons across datasets

---

## Weeks 11-15

- Scientific Visualization
- Alternative visualization platforms
- Dashboarding
- Group projects

notes:
Toward the end of class we are going to have a slightly more free-form set of
discussion points.  Your final projects will be somewhat open-ended, requiring
more group work and collaboration than the preceding assignments.

---

# Class Mission

Your role as a _consumer_ of visualizations should change to also include the
perspective of a _producer_ of visualizations.

You should be comfortable reading _and_ writing imagery.

notes:
We will be discussing this as the semester goes on, but the principal outcome I
want you to take away from this class is understanding how to transform data
into its visual representation, and to take that understanding with you as you
observe visualizations presented to you.

By developing visualizations, you will grow to understand the choices that
influence those visualizations, and you will bring that with you while
consuming information visually.

---

## The Things I Want You To Take Away

- You should know the basics of how to manipulate data -- aggregations,
  filtering, and other operations.
- I want you to know _some_ of the packages that are out there to visualize
  data.  These will mostly be Python-based, with a couple in Javascript.
- You won't learn how to use dashboarding software in detail.  Instead, we
  will talk about the different operations that go into dashboarding software.
- By the end of the course, you will have had the opportunity to look at and
  build visualizations in several different domains and understand how to
  interpret, critique and improve them.

notes:
This course *will* teach you some things about how to code, how to build
visualizations, but we're going to focus much more on learning about how to
construct visualizations and why we make the choices that we do.  If we choose
one way to present data, does that convey information more readily?  Or does it
get in the way of the underlying meaning?

---

## Overview - Themes and Goals

1. What are the components of an effective visualization of quantitative data?
1. What tools and ecosystems are available for visualizing data?
1. What systems can be put in place to generate visualizations rapidly and with high-fidelity representation?

---

## Why aren't we learning viz software X?

This is an *introduction* to data visualization - we will focus on the *fundamentals that underlie* all visualization tools, with a preference for Open Source tools.

... but check out:

 * [Tableau videos on MediaSpace](https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/tag/tagid/tableau) and Prof. [Wonderlich](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/michael-wonderlich)'s courses. (Though, you might want to [check out some of the press](https://www.geekwire.com/2023/tableau-has-been-killed-by-salesforce-past-and-current-tableau-employees-gather-at-irish-wake/) about the future of development of Tableau.)
 * [R/PowerBI](https://www.coursera.org/programs/coursera-for-illinois-gp2ja/learn/tools-exploratory-data-analysis-business) Coursera courses (that you get for free as a UIUC student!)

---

## Structure of Class

- Topic introduction and lecture (60-80 minutes, usually Monday)
- Hands-on, in-class coding (Monday and Wednesday)
- Lab time (usually Wednesday)
- Wrap-up (as needed)

This isn't the first time we've taught this course, but we are always trying new things.  This semester, we're going to be focusing much more on separating apart the theory and the practice of visualization, and we're also going to be using PrairieLearn so that we can try out different tools.

![[images/structure-of-class 2023-08-18 15.06.16.excalidraw.svg]]

notes:
This structure will likely be deviated from during the course, but in general we will start with lecture, take a break, then continue with collaborative or hands-on exercises using group coding.

During the group coding, I might lead the class in some visualization in Python, Javascript, or something else.  During this section, I expect that students will *follow along* with what is going on -- typing in the specific commands, and maybe even trying different things as we go.  It is not meant to simply be a "performance" of coding, but instead an opportunity to learn.

---

## Grading

- 40% Standard assignments in prose or code form (see syllabus about 'required' assignments)
- 25% Lab assignments which allow for "real time" checking of answers and feedback
- 5% Quizzes on material covered in class
- 30% Final project

**We will drop the lowest homework score, however there are some required assignments.**

notes:
Your weekly assignments will take different forms.  The first assignment will
be exclusively prose and hand-writing, but subsequent assignments will be
either notebook (coding) based or prose-based as well.

The final project will be described later in class, but will take the form of a
group project that touches on coding as well as visual design.

---

## Homework Summary

- Mix of prose and code
- Assigned on Canvas, usually completed on PrairieLearn
- Grading done by the instructional team with occasional feedback from PrairieLearn
- Two extra credit options, assigned toward end of class
- 40% of grade (maximum, including extra credit), lowest score dropped except for required assignments
- A total of 6 Homeworks in the course
- Generally due on Wednesdays (but always double check the due dates!)

---

## Labs Summary

- Code only
- Assigned on Canvas, completed on PrairieLearn
- Grading done "automatically" on PrairieLearn - see example autograding in Homework 1
- Can be attempted multiple times before the due date
- 25% of grade, no assignments dropped
- 7 Labs in the course
- Generally due on Wednesdays (but always double check the due dates!)

---

## Quizzes Summary

- Cover material that is covered in class
- Short answer/multiple choice
- Graded automatically on PrairieLearn
- Can be attempted multiple times _with decreasing scores_
- ~10 Quizzes in the course
- Generally due on *Sundays* (but always double check the due dates!)

---

## Plagiarism

- Plagiarism is about copying ideas.
- Cite all code you utilize from elsewhere.

notes:
When programming, I expect that you will do things like search on the internet
to find help with a given problem.  This is fine.

But, you *must* cite where any code snippets came from.  And you *must* note if
you are working with other people in the group!

Using snippets of code is fine -- but you may not copy large-scale amounts of
code from other work (for example, other visualizations) and pass it off as
your own.  Always cite, and be reasonable in what you utilize.


---

## Our tools

- Python (possibly with some Javascript along the way)
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) & Jupyter notebooks
- The occasional usage of a shell such as bash
- Git & [GitHub](https://github.com/) (toward end of class)
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) 
- Markdown & [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co) for hosting apps
- Slack

notes:
You will be expected to write code in Python, and to learn the very basics of
Javascript.  Your projects may be turned in via git.  We will also utilize
Slack for class communication.

---

## Slack

We have a Slack channel for peer-to-peer discussion and questions about assignments.

**No discussion of grades can happen in Slack.**

https://is445-spr2025.slack.com/

---

## PrairieLearn

We're going to be using [PrairieLearn](https://us.prairielearn.com/) this semester.  You can find our course instance at:

https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/161389/

We'll try it out today and you can see how we can use it for in-class coding as well as for assignments.

---

## Viz Systems We Will Cover

In approximate order:

- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [bqplot](https://bqplot.readthedocs.io/)
- [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite)
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html)


There'll be a few more along the way.

---

## Slack

We will be sharing a slack channel with the in-person class, so feel free to converse with them as well!

 * Team channel at `https://is445-spr2025.slack.com`
   * `#general` : General announcements, place to ask questions
   * `#random` : see a cool viz you want to share?  This is the place!
   * `#introduce-yourself` : where you want to "say hi" for Homework #1
   * `#ASSIGNMENTX-questions` : each assignment will have [a channel](https://slack.com/help/articles/205239967-Join-a-channel) for asking questions specific to that assignment

---

## Slack (cont)

- Use the `@` sign appropriately: `@[person]`, `@here`, `@channel`
- Web client, standalone client and mobile devices can access this team.
- At the end of the semester, the team will be discontinued.
- Please think carefully before direct messaging if you could ask in a public forum instead.
- Conduct will be held to same standards as any educational venue.

Slack turn-around time ~24 business hours or less (general/section channel), email ~3 business days or less

Questions about grades should _always_ be over email.

---

## How do I access Slack?

- Your @illinois email should enough to get you on, just go to: [https://is445-spr2025.slack.com](https://is445-spr2025.slack.com/)
- Send me an email with _your_ email

---

## Choose Your Own Adventure

(Have any of you ever "read" a [CYOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) book?)

There are probably at least three pathways to consider in this course:

1. "I am here to get better at programming and play with viz platforms"
1. "I am thinking about a career in data viz."
1. "I don't know/I am new to programming and I want to focus on that."


---


## Choose Your Own Adventure

**"I am here to get better at programming and play with viz platforms"**

Strategy:

- Look at the code and the extended examples
- Do the Javascript parts


---


## Choose Your Own Adventure

**"I am thinking about a career in data viz."**

Strategy:

- Look at the code and the extended examples
- Do the Javascript parts
- Read the optional texts and documents

---

## Choose Your Own Adventure

**"I don't know!"** or **"I am new to programming and I want to focus on that."**

Strategy:

- Look at the code, focus heavily on Python
- Read the prep notebooks before class!
- Do the Javascript parts _in class_ and build on them for any homework
- Come back to the optional texts and documents after the course is over

---

# Pause to check out Homework \#1

notes:
at this stage - go over the "log onto Slack", "syllabus quiz" and "intake survey" parts of the assignment

we will get to the Python notebook "Introduction to PrairieLearn" sections next section

---

## Today

 * What is a visualization?
 * Why do we visualize?
 * What types of data do we visualize?
 * How do we visualize?

Tamara Munzer, <i>Visualization Analysis & Design</i>
</p>

---

## What is a visualization?

Data Viz is **task-oriented**.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://www.savalli.us/BIO370/Anatomy/AnatomyImages/TyrannosaurusSkeletonLabel.jpg" data-background-size="auto" -->

notes:
I really like this definition because it gives us a sense of purpose - i.e. that our visualization must help a human with a task that has to do with data.

here for example, we might want to know the labels of bones or how they fit together


---

## What is a visualization?

Artistic representations are used to convey emotions:

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://i.etsystatic.com/5150206/r/il/fe175b/1823842266/il_570xN.1823842266_b9y3.jpg" data-background-size="auto" -->


---


## What is a visualization?

Movies, comics, or other cinematic representations are used to tell stories:

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="http://www.dinopit.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/funny-dinosaur.jpg" data-background-size="auto" -->

notes:
we will be using artistic concepts and elements of storytelling, BUT that is not our focus -- here we are TASK oriented.

---
### Data Viz is a big topic

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/diagram_for_gradclass.png" data-background-size="auto 75%" -->

notes:
this is another way of looking at this.

here is the overall diagram of the things we'll cover in this class -- you can see there are a lot of topics from different areas and they are all interconnected.


---

## Why visualize?

Visualization **augments** human data analysis capabilities:

- It enhances our ability to pattern find
- It allows us to summarize data quickly
- It allows us to search our data quickly

(Conversely, why _wouldn't_ we visualize?)

notes:
Not everything suits itself to visualization -- and part of the reason for that
is the necessary reductionism that visualization can require.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/fov.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

notes:
Visual information is communicated through our eyes, where it is processed.  At
the most basic level, we can see a range of about 210 degrees horizontally with
one or both eyes.  The region that is covered by both ("binocular") is about
114 degrees in extent.

You can only cram so much information into the human eye.

notes:
When we think about visual communication of information, we *must* think about
how human physiology interacts with that communication.

Also, fair warning: I'm not a medical doctor.

This diagram shows the visual acuity of a "standard" human eye, as a function
of angular distance from the fovea.  We have to think about this in
*conjunction* with our field of view.

## Your brain does interpolation

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/dotsillusion.jpg" data-background-size="auto 50%" -->

There are 12 dots, can you count them all at the same time?


---


## Your brain does interpolation

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/blindspotcross.png" data-background-size="auto" -->

1. Look at the cross
1. Close left eye, keep looking at the cross
1. Slowly move your head toward & away from screen until dot disappears


---


## Your brain does interpolation

Even despite these oddities, the visual cortex is great for information transfer!

Your visual cortex is processing information from different parts of this page **at the same time** -- it can do impressive things very quickly!

---

## Can you spot the difference?

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://www.rd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Can-You-Spot-the-10-Differences-in-This-Picture-_585659516-Ksenya-Savva.jpg" data-background-size="auto 75%" -->

notes:
compare this to how long it would take to spot differences in 2 songs - you'd have to listen to both songs (probably more than once) and compare after!  This would be sequential rather than parallel data transfer!

---

## Try it with sound

- [Moonlight Sonata, 1](https://soundcloud.com/redreapergrell/beethoven-moonlight-sonata)
- [Moonlight Sonata, 2](https://soundcloud.com/user-37232775/sets/beethoven-moonlight-sonata)

Try doing the same thing with these on your own!

notes:
time this activity, give them 1.5 minutes

ask: how long did this take you?  How many differences were there?
I spotted tempo as one (but you can cheat by looking at the timer on the bottom!)

Also, you can look at how different each of the sound-bars are on each link and see how different the music looks visually!

---

## I need a volunteer!

notes:
(This part is a bit of a stunt.  Sorry.)

See what I mean?  It's a stunt.  You're supposed to hear these, or look at the
numbers, and not have as clear an impression.  It also takes a lot longer.

![FRED Graph](/spr2025-bcg-bcu/week01/images/fredgraph.png)

notes:
You might immediately notice a few things about this image, but one item that
we will talk about as class goes on is that often visualizations can have a
consistent style.  FRED in particular has a "branding" that is quite obvious,
even without the logo.

## Anscombe's Quartet

This famous example shows 4 datasets with the exact same mean, variance and correlation coefficient.

Statistics can be useful, but visualization generated context!

# Who are you visualizing for?

- For yourself?
- For a peer?
- For someone else?

notes:
*Whenever* you build a visualization you need to think about the context that
you can assume on the part of your viewer.

---

# Tenet 1:

"Visualizing data" is not a strict subset of "making an image."

- Collection of the data
- Organization of that data
- Representation of that data

notes:
We will approach visualization as encompassing several different stages in the
collection, organization and representation of data.

---

# Tenet 2:

We tell lies to visualize, but we _must_ be honest.

- No representation is going to convey the entire complexity of a dataset.
- Some representations are better than others.

# Tenet 2:

"The Principle of Proportional Ink" -- [callingbullshit.org](https://callingbullshit.org/)

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/proportionalInk.png" data-background-size="auto 50%" -->

notes:
So let's first talk about how misleading visualizations can be. This 3D pie chart violates the "principle of proportional ink" which states that the number of pixels that represent a value should be proportional to the value. With the raised edge on the pie chart, the blue wedge gets way more ink than it deserves and you get a disproportionate sense of value.

# Tenet 2:

"Spurious Correlations" -- [tylervigen.com](https://tylervigen.com/)

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/spurious.png" data-background-size="auto 50%" -->

notes:
you can have a lot of absurd fun with data - but when data is presented in a visualization, people often believe the authority of it even if it's outlandish.

This website has some good ideas of where to find sample datasets for upcoming homework assignments too!

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/barCharts.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

notes:
Each of these bar chart examples are meant to show the same data. But you can see how they're a bit problematic.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/gunDeaths.jpg" data-background-size="contain" -->

notes:
Now here's an example that's more brazen. I'll give you a minute to analyze this and tell me what's wrong with this graph.

Some people will claim the Y-axis should always start from the bottom - at zero - to avoid confusion.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/keelingCurve.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

notes:
however, the Keeling Curve is an interesting counter-argument. This is the famous graph that was the original evidence for global warming, showing the rate at which atmospheric carbon dioxide was growing.

Does anyone know why it's generally accepted to show the y-axis like this, without it starting at the zero axis?

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/hearts_battery.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

notes:
here are a few more representations of data that you've probably run into!

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/hearts_battery.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/battery.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

<div style="padding-top: 15em;" data-markdown=true>

1. Sensors read the current "fill" of the battery
   - Analog / digital conversion
   - Normalized with respect to expected "full"
1. This is then scaled to a percentage
1. The battery image is filled from left to right
1. The image is then rasterized and displayed

</div>

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/hearts_bw.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

- Some fixed maximum amount of damage
- Each time damage is taken, decrement
- Each time damage is reversed, increment
- Display number of hearts as appropriate

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/stitch_bg.png" data-background-size="contain"-->

notes:
This is a screenshot from the movie "Lilo and Stitch" where the little girl Lilo is graphing how much evil is in the alien Stitch. It borrows from a familiar visual - the thermometer. But how could this visualization be misinterpreted? How is it different from a thermometer?

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/stitch_nobg.png" data-background-size="contain"-->

notes:
The angle can be misleading. So can the relative width of the head vs the feet. The surface area is not consistent from top to bottom. Also there are empty areas in the mouth and eyes!

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/stitch_nobg_tilted.png" data-background-size="contain"-->

notes:
If we rotate the image so that the red liquid is level, do we get a different impression for how much bad is in Stitch?

## Election Maps

Mark Newman of the University of Michigan has created visualizations of the
election maps from several of the most recent elections.  For more information
and context, see his page http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/ .

- [Map 1](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/statemapredbluer1024.png)
- [Map 2](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/statepopredblue1024.png)
- [Map 3](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/countymapredbluer1024.png)
- [Map 4](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/countymappurpler1024.png)
- [Map 5](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/countycartpurple1024.png)

notes:
These are great, but some criticisms might be that the color red is more apparent to the human eye than the color blue. And in the population-to-area adjusted maps, it's difficult to read for people used to geographic accuracy.

Map1 - this is just a geographical map of red and blue

Map2 - cartogram weighted by population (note, NOT by electoral college population)

Map3 - election results by county

Map4 - percentage of votes by county

Map5 - percentage of votes by county, weighted by population

## Getting started in Python

*Let's check out the Python part of Homework \#1!*

notes:

**if taking a break -- fire up notebooks now!!**
 
* fire up the notebook with HW1 that has NO auto grading
* fire up the notebook with HW1 that DOES have autograding
* look at extra HW assignment problem -- varients
* look at the UNGRADED workbook -- if you want to follow along
* talk about installing locally

## This week: Wrap-up

 1. We visualize to change how we understand things.
 1. We visualize data for ourselves, for our peers, and for others.
 1. Visualization is a series of steps that we take to produce a different
    representation of data.
